# Julia-LSTM
Run with `julia lstm.jl`. Default branch does computation on CPU, GPU branch does computation with ArrayFire but is still a WIP. 

Implementation of a basic LSTM neural net in Julia. Based off of [this](https://github.com/nicodjimenez/lstm) implentation of an LSTM in Python which is based off of [this](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf) paper on LSTMs.
